    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "INTEGER\n",
    "TEXT\n",
    "REAL\n",
    "BLOB\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Keys are the unique identifier of a record within a table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a key contained within table A, that is the primary key in another table (B).  It may not be unique in table A, but it allows one to JOIN with table B to retrieve additional data.  It will be unique in table B.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering the relationships between different tables within a database, they can be of the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-One: Each record in table A can be mapped to one record in table B (e.g. Table of Names and Table of Birthdays)\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-Many: Each record in table A can be mapped to multiple records in table B (e.g. Table of Addresses, and Table of Names.  More than one person may live at each address).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-Many: Multiple records in table A map to multiple records in table B (e.g. table of cities, and table of restaurant brands). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LEFT JOIN: Takes all records from the left table, but only matching records from the right table are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN: Takes all records from the right table, but only matching records from the left table are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "INNER JOIN: Only records that appear in both tables are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "OUTER JOIN: Only records that appear in neither table are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate function are used to compute statistics like mean, count etc.  When used in conjunction with a table, SQL will not know what population the aggregate function is to be applied to wihtout a corresponding GROUP BY statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "They provide a means of tracking the relationships between tables in a many-to-many JOIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
